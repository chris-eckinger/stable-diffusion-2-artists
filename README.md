# Description


This repo contains a curated list of artists whose names can be added to Stable Diffusion prompts to change the art style. Images are provided to give a rough idea of how Stable Diffusion interprets their style.

Most of the artists listed here are either modern digital artists or have a style that I think is cool.

All images are generated with model 2.1 and the following parameters:

Prompt: \<artist name> art
Seed: 0
Size: 768x768
Guidance Scale: 7.5
